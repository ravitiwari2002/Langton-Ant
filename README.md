# Langton's Ant

Langton's Ant is a JavaScript-based project that simulates the movements of an imaginary ant on a 2D grid. This project showcases how simple rules can lead to the emergence of complex patterns, offering a unique perspective on the mathematical problem of Langtonâ€™s Ant.

A 4-state two-dimensional Turing machine. The ant starts out on a grid and then follows the following set of rules.

1. If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90 degrees and moves forward one unit.

2. If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90 degrees and moves forward one unit.

3. When the ant leaves a square, it inverts the color.

When the ant is started on an empty grid, it eventually builds a "highway" that is a series of 104 steps that repeat indefinitely, each time displacing the ant two pixels vertically and horizontally.

## Features
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the number of ants on the grid.
- **Speed Control**: Control the speed of ant movement.
- **Reset**: Start over with a clean slate.
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume the simulation at any time.
- **Print PDF**: Generate a PDF of all ant movements.
- **Generate Image**: Create an image of ant movements.
