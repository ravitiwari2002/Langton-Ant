# Langton's Ant

Langton's Ant is a JavaScript-based project that simulates the movements of an imaginary ant on a 2D grid. This project showcases how simple rules can lead to the emergence of complex patterns, offering a unique perspective on the mathematical problem of Langtonâ€™s Ant.

## Features
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the number of ants on the grid.
- **Speed Control**: Control the speed of ant movement.
- **Reset**: Start over with a clean slate.
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume the simulation at any time.
- **Print PDF**: Generate a PDF of all ant movements.
- **Generate Image**: Create an image of ant movements.
